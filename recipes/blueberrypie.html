    <h2>Blueberry Pie with Frozen Berries</h2>
    <p>Blueberry pie is the best when made with fresh-picked berries! It is a beautiful sight with a lattice top.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>5 cups frozen blueberries</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2¼ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup salted butter</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons cold water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon salted butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Make the filling: Combine frozen blueberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and salt in a medium pot; mix well to coat blueberries. Cook over medium-high heat, stirring often, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the crust: Combine flour and salt in a large mixing bowl. Cut in 3/4 cup butter with 2 knives or pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Add water, 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing with a fork, until flour mixture is moistened.</li>
        <li>Divide the dough in half and shape into balls. Roll out 1 dough ball with a rolling pin into a 10-inch circle. Transfer crust to a 9-inch pie dish. Trim the edge of the crust with scissors and crimp the rim with fingertips and knuckles.</li>
        <li>Pour filling into prepared pie crust. Dot with 1 tablespoon butter. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and bubbly, about 30 minutes.</li>

    </ol>
