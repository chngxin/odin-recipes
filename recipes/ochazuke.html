    <h2>Ochazuke (Green Tea Over Rice)</h2>
    <p>Craving a dish that is light yet comforting? This easy, homemade Ochazuke with green tea or dashi, steamed rice, and simple savory ingredients will hit the spot.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Japanese salted salmon</li>
        <li>1 cup cooked Japanese short-grain rice</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon nori seaweed (shredded)</li>
        <li>2 sprigs Japanese parsley</li>
        <li>1 cup dashi</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mirin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>2 teaspoon Japanese green tea leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 425ºF (218ºC). For a convection oven, reduce the cooking temperature by 25ºF (15ºC). Bake the salted salmon fillet (shiojake) for 20-25 minutes until the skin and flesh are blistered and charred (Japanese salted salmon is always cooked until firm and well done). If you’re using regular salmon, season it with a pinch of salt and set it aside for 10 minutes before baking. When it’s cooked, remove the skin and bones and break up the salmon flesh into flakes. Set aside.
        </li>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients in a small saucepan and bring it to a boil. Pour the soup into a small teapot.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the dashi into the bowl to cover half the rice and top with the mitsuba and wasabi. Enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
